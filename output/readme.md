The workflow yields two final output files:
Figure 4b: Bin_34 curated to achieve a higher level of completion and redundancy.
Figure 5: Summary of the new collection of MAGs after manual refining.

Proper manual refinement of MAGs is necessary to elucidate meaningful biological implications. In this protocol, we used a plant-microbiome dataset to identify 69 bins and then curated the bins manually to remove the outliers and contaminants. It is recommended to perform manual refining after automatic binning to recover higher quality MAGs.
